# nvimconf

A few initial plugins installed via [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim):

* [Mason](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim) for installing plugins
    easily.
* [nordic](https://github.com/AlexvZyl/nordic.nvim) for the theme.
* And for the lsp, using
    [lsp-zero](https://github.com/VonHeikemen/lsp-zero.nvim) with a few
    dependencies in order to make the linting, and autocomplete to work.
 * [nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig)
 * [nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp)
 * [nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/hrsh7th/cmp-buffer)
 * [nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/hrsh7th/cmp-nvim-lsp)
 * [nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/williamboman/mason-lspconfig.nvim)
* [vim-airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline) as a replacement
    for Powerline.
